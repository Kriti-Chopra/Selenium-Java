In Java, these terms relate to how you incorporate external code into your projects:
1. Dependency:
A dependency is a broader term that encompasses any external library or module your project needs to function correctly.
It can be a JAR file, a Maven artifact, or any other external code that your project relies on.

2. Maven:
Maven is a build automation tool that helps manage dependencies in Java projects.
It uses a pom.xml file to declare dependencies and their versions, allowing for easy and consistent management of external libraries.
Maven downloads dependencies from a central repository and manages their transitive dependencies automatically.

3. Import Libraries:
In Java, import statements are used to bring in specific classes or packages from external libraries into your code.
Import statements are used after you have added the dependency to your project (e.g., using Maven).

Here's a simple breakdown:
Dependency: The external library or module your project needs.
Maven: A tool to manage dependencies and build your project.
Import: The statement used to access classes from a dependency within your code.
